# IsThisTextOffensive
This is a machine learning project made to classify whether the text is offensive or not. <br/>
We trained the model using tensorflow. In the future, this could be used for many things, such as to detect whether a post on social media is offensive or not and hopefully prevent cyberbullying.

## Technologies used
- html
- css
- js
- flask
- tensorflow
- boostrap
- jquery

## How to run
**Due to the large file size of the tensorflow model, we are unable to upload it on github, you would have to open up the ipynb file and execute all the code yourself before running the flask server**

Make sure u have tensorflow, tensorflow_hub and flask installed. Then use
```
python app.py
```
to run the server and enjoy.

## Future improvements
Improve the machine learning model by decreasing the loss function even more.
